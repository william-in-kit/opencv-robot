visual servo control with a 3 Dof robot arm
-----------------------------------------------
I build this robot with 3 Dof to test visual servo control, the camera was fixed at the second link. I use two arduino as control board. one for image processing, one for robot control, use i2c to communicate.There are two examples, one for ping-pong tracking, another is visual servo control with obstacle avoidance. The result are showed in video.
